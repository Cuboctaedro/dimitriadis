Works included in the exhibition:  “The Trap”

At the end of corridor, on the sixth floor of one of the abandoned building of Humboldt University in Berlin is the room – trap. The space, evacuated of all human presence is inhabited now only with spiders and flies. The entry to the room is accessible for both of them. But not the exit. The coexistence of both of these insects inside this space is impossible. Impossible because, the one, the fly, constitutes food for the other, the spider. Thus, this space itself offers no future to either of them.  The room becomes the “un – natural” equation of victim and perpetrator.
